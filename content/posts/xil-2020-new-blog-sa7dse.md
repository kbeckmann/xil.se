## A new beginning

I am very excited to welcome you to our shiny new blog.

We hope to post lots of engaging new content on anything the xil members might find interesting. This could be anything from [CTF writeups]({{<ref "/categories/writeups/">}}), ham radio, [security]({{<ref "/categories/security/">}}), PCB design, hardware used for hardware manufacturing, systems administration, food hacking, to general hacker space updates.
I have heard rumours that [kbeckmann]({{<ref "/author/kbeckmann">}}) might be preparing a series of posts on FPGAs.

If you don't want to miss any of those posts make sure to follow us on twitter [@xil_hackerspace](https://twitter.com/xil_hackerspace).
